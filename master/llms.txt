# Quality improvement charts for R

`qicharts2` is an R package with functions for making run charts,
Shewhart control charts and Pareto charts for continuous quality
improvement. Included control charts are: I, MR, Xbar, S, T, C, U, U’,
P, P’, and G charts.

Non-random variation in the form of minor to moderate persistent shifts
in data over time is identified by the Anhoej rules for unusually long
runs and unusually few crossing \[Anhoej, Olesen (2014)
<https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0113825>\].

Non-random variation in the form of larger, possibly transient, shifts
is identified by Shewhart’s 3-sigma rule \[Mohammed, Worthington,
Woodall (2008) <https://doi.org/10.1136/qshc.2004.012047>\].

## Exported functions

- [`qic()`](reference/qic.md) Run and control charts.

- [`summary.qic()`](reference/summary.qic.md) Summary of qic object.

- [`paretochart()`](reference/paretochart.md) Pareto charts.

- [`bchart()`](reference/bchart.md) Bernoulli CUSUM chart

## Included datasets

- **hospital_infections** Number of hospital acquired bacteremia,
  Clostridium difficile infections, and urinary tract infections in six
  hospitals.

- **cabg** Individual coronary artery bypass graft operations.

- **cdi** Hospital acquired Clostridium difficile infections (CDI)

- **nhs_accidents** Number of attendances to major accident and
  emergency hospital departments in the NHS that were seen within 4
  hours of arrival over twenty weeks.

- **gtt** Adverse events during hospitalisation found by the Global
  Trigger Tool.
